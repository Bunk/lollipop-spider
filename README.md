===============

Have you ever wondered how sites like [LolKing][1] and [Elophant][2] get their data?  Well, sure, there are addon clients that they may want you to install that can gather this data for them.  That's so mundane, though.  Why not be a ninja and utilize a library that acts like a real League client instead?

This project has a dependency on [lollipop][3] and will crawl whatever information it can based on whatever users are setup.  It will eventually have some smarts around how it crawls, how it prioritizes lookups, and trying its best to consume the data.
